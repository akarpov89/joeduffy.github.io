My book, Concurrent Programming on Windows, is shaping up quite nicely.  (Given
that I've been working on it for over a year now, I suppose it had better be!)
I've been surprised at the amazing level of anticipation and excitement from
blog readers, coworkers, and Microsoft customers, and I really can't wait for it
to be finished.  Thanks for the patience so far.

I feel like I'm almost on the home stretch.  End of September is my current target
for completion.  It's looking like it'll contain 18 chapters, with 3 appendices,
and will have a total running length of somewhere around 700 pages.  The reasons
it has taken so long are numerous, but the primary reason is that the content is
quite deep and detail-oriented—more than I expected at the start—and I've wanted
to take the time to get it just right rather than cut corners.  My editors recently
gave me feedback that there will be very little developmental editing required, since
I'm (ahem) very, uhh, meticulous when it comes to writing.  And feedback from
technical reviewers has been very positive as well.  I think both are good
news.

I'm confident the end product will be worth the wait.

In the meantime, it seems that some of the abstractions I've built while writing
the book will likely become part of a future release of the .NET Framework.
Keep an eye out on Channel9 for some additional details in a few months time.
Right now is a super exiting time to be in the field of computer science, that's
for sure...  Laissez les bons temps rouler!
