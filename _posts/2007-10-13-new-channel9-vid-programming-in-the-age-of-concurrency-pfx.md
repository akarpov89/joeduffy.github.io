Charles from Channel9 recorded a conversation with Anders and me a couple weeks back.
The topic?  Concurrency.  More specifically, [Parallel FX (PFX)](http://www.bluebytesoftware.com/blog/Default.aspx#a5a15898b-6c1e-46cb-8553-04f08bb9336e):

> Microsoft is developing a number of technologies to simplify the expression

> Framework (PFX), a managed programming model for data parallelism, task parallelism,
> scheduling, and coordination on parallel hardware.

We don't go too deep, but you can bet we'll be doing more of these things as the
technology matures and gets closer to general availability.  Enjoy!
