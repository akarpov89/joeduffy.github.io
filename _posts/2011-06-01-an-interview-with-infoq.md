InfoQ recently asked me a few questions about concurrency and programming languages,
and here is what I had to say:

> [http://www.infoq.com/articles/Interview-Joe-Duffy](http://www.infoq.com/articles/Interview-Joe-Duffy)

A little teaser:

> _"The major shift we face will be that mainstream languages will start to incorporate
more concurrency-safety -- immutability and isolation -- and the platform libraries
and architectures will better support this style of software decomposition. OOP developers
are accustomed to partitioning their program into classes and objects; now they will
need to become accustomed to partitioning their program into asynchronous Actors
that can run concurrently. Within this sea of asynchrony will lay ordinary imperative
code, frequently augmented with fine-grained task and data parallelism."_

As an aside, I know I've been super quiet lately.  I never thought I'd go months
without blogging.  My sincere apologies for this; work has been too all-consuming
/ fun, and I've been unable to carve out much time for anything else.  (Speaking
of which, we are still hiring: email me at joedu at you-know-where dot com if you
are interested.)  I'm about to head out to Europe for a few weeks, where hopefully
I'll have a bit of time to write up something exciting to share.  Cheers.
