I mentioned a few months back that my team had collaborated with MSR to publish a
paper to OOPSLA about some novel aspects of our programming language (see [here](http://www.bluebytesoftware.com/blog/2012/10/28/UniquenessAndReferenceImmutabilityForSafeParallelism.aspx)
and [here](http://www.bluebytesoftware.com/blog/2012/12/08/ImperativeFunctional.aspx)).

I was excited when Jonathan over at InfoQ asked to interview me about this work.
We had a fun back and forth, and I hope the result helps to clarify some of the design
goals and decisions we made along the way.
