I've been managing software teams for several years. Perhaps more importantly,
I have worked for some excellent leaders and have had the opportunity to learn from
their good (and bad) habits.

Because I haven't written a line of .NET code in a few years now, that blogging
well has kind of run dry. And sadly my team is not yet ready to openly share our
platform externally, so I cannot blog about that either.

As a result, I thought it would be fun to start a series about leadership in software.
Not just the kind of leadership expected of managers, but also individual developers
and architects. I have no idea how frequently I'll write something, however just
having a continuum of content to contribute to when I have a spare moment will help
liven this place back up again, I'm sure. Furthermore, one lesson that's been
imparted upon me over the years is that "writing is thinking"; so by writing this
stuff down, I'm sure it will crystalize even further.

The series will be called "Software Leadership" because, after all, it's about
the software. I hope you enjoy.
