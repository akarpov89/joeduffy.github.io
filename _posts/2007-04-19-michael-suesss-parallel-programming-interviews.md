Michael Suess, author of the ver nice blog [thinkingparallel.com](http://www.thinkingparallel.com/),
recently ran a series of interviews.  He asked five parallelism experts
from different domains (Erlang, MPI, OpenMP, POSIX threads, .NET threads) to
answer the same set of questions:

- [Joe Armstrong for Erlang](http://www.thinkingparallel.com/2007/03/20/ten-questions-with-joe-armstrong-about-parallel-programming-and-erlang/)

- [William Gropp for MPI](http://www.thinkingparallel.com/2007/03/29/ten-questions-with-william-gropp-about-parallel-programming-and-mpi/)

- [Sanjiv Shah for OpenMP](http://www.thinkingparallel.com/2007/04/03/ten-questions-with-sanjiv-shah-about-parallel-programming-and-openmp/)

- [David Butenhof for POSIX Threads](http://www.thinkingparallel.com/2007/04/11/ten-questions-with-david-butenhof-about-parallel-programming-and-posix-threads/)

- [Me for .NET Threads](http://www.thinkingparallel.com/2007/04/18/ten-questions-with-joe-duffy-about-parallel-programming-and-net-threads/)

It's interesting to see the range of answers given.  We agree on many things,
but our different backgrounds really shine through in other cases.
