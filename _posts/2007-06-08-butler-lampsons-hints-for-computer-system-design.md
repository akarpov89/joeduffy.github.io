I recently read Butler Lampson's immensely wonderful paper ["Hints for Computer
System Design"](http://research.microsoft.com/Lampson/33-Hints/Abstract.html) (
[HTML](http://research.microsoft.com/Lampson/33-Hints/WebPage.html), [PDF](http://research.microsoft.com/Lampson/33-Hints/Acrobat.pdf)).

Yeah, yeah, I'm only 24 years behind the times.  In the paper, Butler offers
many principles backed by concrete examples illustrating tradeoffs between functionality,
speed, and fault-tolerance, drawn mostly from his experience building operating and
distributed systems.  As I read it the paper, I was struck by how much his advice
applies to building just about any kind of complicated software system, including
frameworks.

A few quotes that I quite liked:

--

> Designing a computer system is very different from designing an algorithm:
> 
> > The external interface (that is, the requirement) is less precisely defined,
> > more complex, and more subject to change.
> > 
> > The system has much more internal structure, and hence many internal interfaces.
> > 
> > The measure of success is much less clear.

> The designer usually finds himself floundering in a sea of possibilities, unclear
> about how one choice will limit his freedom to make other choices, or affect the
> size and performance of the entire system. There probably isn't a 'best' way
> to build the system, or even any major part of it; much more important is to avoid
> choosing a terrible way, and to have clear division of responsibilities among the
> parts.

Needless to say, I strongly recommend the paper.
