Haskell is _the _most underappreciated yet extraordinarily significant programming
language in the world.  The syntax is frightening enough to scare off those
with weak stomaches, but some of the most interesting and creative research in type
systems and, within recent years, parallelism have arisen from the Haskell community.
I recently stumbled across a fascinating paper from the ACM SIGPLAN History of Programming
Languages Conference (HOPL'III) from earlier this year:

> [A History of Haskell: being lazy with class](http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/papers/history-of-haskell/index.htm)
>
>
>
> **Abstract** _This long (55-page) paper describes the history of Haskell, including
its genesis and principles, technical contributions, implementations and tools, and
applications and impact._

First I'll admit that I'm a functional programming geek.  Second I'll admit
that I love reading about technology history.  But those biases aside, the paper
is really quite good.  Recommended reading for anybody who's ever run across
a lambda floating around in their dreams.  I know that I have.
