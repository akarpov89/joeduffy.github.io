[Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/) has some very thought proviking
opinions, expressed both in his [online
essays](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html) and  [new
book](http://www.paulgraham.com/hackpaint.html).

I just stumbled across [this audio
recording](http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail188.html) of his OSCON
talk from earlier this year. The topic is great hackers. One of the best talks
I've heard in a long time.

The roughly equivalent transcript can be [found
here](http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html).
