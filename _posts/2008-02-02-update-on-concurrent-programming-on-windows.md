I'm still plugging away at my new concurrency book.

The fact that we have cover art and that it's [available for pre-order on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Concurrent-Programming-Windows-Vista-Architecture/dp/032143482X)
are both great signs that it's getting close to being done.

The full TOC (as of right now) is [available here](http://www.bluebytesoftware.com/books/winconc/winconc_book_resources.html).
A few chapters are still in the works, and there's a bit of editing ahead.
I've also decided to write Appendices on PFX and CCR.  In the meantime, definitely
feel free to pick up a PDF of some early content via [RoughCuts](http://safari.oreilly.com/9780321434821).
Believe it or not, this is a way to provide real-time feedback that can impact the
book before it hits the presses.

I have to say this is the most complicated piece of writing I've ever undertaken.
Not only does the material require going very deep in a lot of hard areas, but I've
noticed that as a community we're learning to speak speak better and to use consistent
terminology about various aspects of concurrency.  To stay relevant, I'm
finding a fair bit of content has had to be reworked several times.

At the same time, and from a selfish standpoint, this book has been a wonderful forcing
function to learn everything there is to know about concurrency.  Not that this
is a realistic goal, mind you, but gosh darnit _I'm trying_.  I'm convinced
at this point that the best way to become an expert on something is to try to teach
it to other people.  And what better way than writing a book?  If you can't
explain it _clearly _to a broad, on-the-average-less-expert-than-you audience, you
probably have a faulty mental model to begin with.  The process of merely trying
usually reveals this.  I encourage everybody out there to try it.  At least
once.
