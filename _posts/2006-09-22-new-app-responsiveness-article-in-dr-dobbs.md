An article I wrote (seemingly ages ago) just appeared in the September issue of Dr.
Dobb's journal:

> [Application Responsiveness: Using concurrency to enhance user experiences](http://www.ddj.com/dept/windows/192700235)
> Thanks to recent innovation in both hardware graphics processors and client-side
> development frameworks, GUIs for Windows applications have become more and more
> visually stunning over time. But throughout the evolution of such frameworks, one
> problem hasn't gone away: poor responsiveness.  Studies show that positive user
> experiences are linked to application responsiveness and, conversely, that
> frustrating experiences are often caused by poor responsiveness.  More often than
> not, this lack of responsiveness is due to a series of subtle (and sometimes
> accidental) design choices made during development. In this article, I examine the
> root of the responsiveness problem, and then suggest some best practices for
> eliminating it.

My article only touches on some important issues that are described in detail elsewhere.
