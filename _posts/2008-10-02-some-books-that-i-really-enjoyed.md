It's been quite some time since I blogged about what I've been reading.  That's
not because I haven't been reading -- au contraire! -- but rather because I've been
busy doing so.  I find these posts interesting for myself, so that I can look
back and see where my interests were at a particular point in time.  Given
the sheer number of additions, I can't properly rate them like I have in the past.
Here are the more interesting ones, those that stick out in my mind:

Based on this list, you might surmise that I read a lot.  ;)  In fact,
I typically have between 3 and 5 books going simultaneously (how parallel of me),
so I use the term "read" somewhat nontraditionally.  I prefer to absorb the
information by immersing myself in many books in the same genre simultaneously, instead
of committing to a single one.  This seems to be effective, but is also slightly
odd and perhaps quite esoteric to other people; the result is that every room in
my home is littered with books each in some possibly long-forgotten state of being
"read" (along with tattered academic papers, language manuals, etc).  I like
it, but some people believe this is an indication that I'm a tad insane.
C'est la vie.
