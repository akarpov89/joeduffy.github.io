I want a 32-CPU MP machine with those puppies on it. 1,024 cores anybody? 
[Engadget](http://www.engadget.com/2006/07/10/intel-goes-multi-core-crazy-for-keifer-server-line/) 
claims each of those cores has 4 hardware threads. 4,096 hardware threads 
anybody?

Engadget goes on to say:

This is a bit of an exaggeration. Server SKUs will take advantage of multi-core 
without problem. It's our client situation that needs a little help, and even 
then the OS has little to do with it.
