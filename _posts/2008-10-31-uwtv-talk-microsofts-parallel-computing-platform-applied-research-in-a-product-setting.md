Dan Grossman invited me to deliver a talk as part of the University of Washington's
Computer Science and Engineering Colloquia series.  It was recorded and will
eventually air on UWTV, but has also been posted online:

> **Microsoft's Parallel Computing Platform: Applied Research in a Product Setting**

> _The goal of Microsoft's Parallel Computing Platform (PCP) team is to enable the
shift to modern, multi- and manycore hardware, by providing a runtime, programming
models, libraries, and tools that make it easy for developers to construct correct,
efficient, maintainable, and scalable programs through the use of parallelism. In
doing so, tens of years of industry research has been combined and applied in a myriad
of ways. This talk examines PCP's current progress, explicitly relating it to specific
research of the past and present, in addition to surveying future efforts and possible
research opportunities._

If you're not aware of the work we're doing in Visual Studio 2010 -- both in .NET
4.0 and C++ -- this talk gives a pretty good overview of all of it.  It has
a researchy feel to it, with plenty of pointers to interesting prior research that
has influenced our work along the way.
