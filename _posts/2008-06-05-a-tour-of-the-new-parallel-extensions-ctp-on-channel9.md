We sat down last week with Charles from Channel9 to discuss the new CTP.  Both
parts got posted today:

- Part 1: [http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/Going+Deep/Inside-Parallel-Extensions-for-NET-2008-CTP-Part-1/](http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/Going+Deep/Inside-Parallel-Extensions-for-NET-2008-CTP-Part-1/)

- Part 2: [http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/Going+Deep/Inside-Parallel-Extensions-for-NET-2008-CTP-Part-2/](http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/Going+Deep/Inside-Parallel-Extensions-for-NET-2008-CTP-Part-2/)

We focus on the new aspects of the stack, incl. the new scheduler and CDS, and also
discuss what's changed in PLINQ and TPL.

If you have ideas for future videos, or any feedback/questions, you know where to
send 'em.  joedu AT youknowwhere DOT com.
