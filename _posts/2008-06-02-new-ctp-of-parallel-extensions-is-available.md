We just released a new CTP of Parallel Extensions to .NET: [get it here](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=348F73FD-593D-4B3C-B055-694C50D2B0F3&displaylang=en).

Some relevant information is up on our team blog:

nobody's perfect)

I'm really excited to see our entire stack finally shipping as one cohesive unit:
the data structures we use throughout the implementation exposed publicly (what
we now call CDS), a new scheduler built from the ground up, TPL and PLINQ better
together, and lots more.  We're still very far from the end of the road, and
have plenty of cool stuff still in the works, but we've made a ton of progress
in just 6 months since our last CTP.

Have fun and, as always, feedback is much appreciated.
