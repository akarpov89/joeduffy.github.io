It seems that I completely blow away and recreate my blog every two years or so.
The time has come.  I ended up horking my prior setup and have moved everything
over to [GitHub](https://github.com/joeduffy/joeduffy.github.io/).

I've not been able to perfectly preserve permalinks, comments, and so on.  I
tried to keep as much the same as possible (e.g., [/feed](/feed) is still the RSS
feed), howevever surely I've screwed something up.  I also know the WordPress
content conversion to MarkDown was imperfect, and will work on cleaning up some
of the older posts by hand in the weeks to come.  Pull requests welcome.  Finally,
there aren't comments.  Feel free to add them on GitHub and I promise to reply;
over time, I'll try to come up with a better solution.

The good news is that I am going to be blogging lots more in the months to come.
In the meantime, if you want to follow my "shorter thoughts," please check me
out on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/xjoeduffyx/).  I always love feedback!
